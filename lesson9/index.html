      <h1>Ethan Moody - Learning Module 9 Assignment</h1>
      <h2>Have you registered for the upcoming semester yet?</h2>
      <p>Not yet!</p>
      <h2>What classes do you plan on registering for?</h2>
      <p>I have to meet with my advisor to determine what would be the best next step for me.</p>
      <h2>What are the three most challenging things you've encountered this semester while taking this course?</h2>
      <p>In no particular order, here are the three challenges I've had to overcome.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Balancing my full time job with schoolwork</li>
        <li>Making time for my friends and family since my days off work are on the weekends, and that's the only time I can really see them OR do homework*</li>
        <li>Wanting to finish quickly and having to go back over typos in my code</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Using one word, what do you think of the text book for this course?</h2>
      <p>Efficacious</p>
      <p>*This was kind of nullified when I got my laptop, but it was definitely a struggle up until that point.</p>
