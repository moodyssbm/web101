      <h1>Interesting Places</h1>
      <p>Welcome! With this site, I hope to provide some insight into some of the places I've visited in the past. The two places I have selected are the ones I believe are the most interesting that I've traveled to. I hope they interest you as much as they interested me.</p>
      <h2 id="right">Italy</h2>
      <p id="right">On the Italy page, you will see that I went to more than just Italy; I went on a cruise! I went with my family when I turned thirteen years old. It was an unforgettable trip, and I hope to let you experience a little bit of that vicariously through my experiences.</p>
      <h2>Honduras</h2>
      <p>Over on the Honduras page, youâ€™ll find that my trip was primarily for business, but I still enjoyed my time there.  It was definitely a huge contrast from my other trip to Italy which will surely make for some excellent content.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p id="left">Thank you for stopping by! Hopefully you were able to enjoy what I had to say about my trips.</p>
