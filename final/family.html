      <h2>Family</h2>
      <p>Family is one of the most important things in my life. My extended family is massive in scale, and I include a handful of my friends as family since I was either raised with them or have interactions with them like a brother would. Writing about every person in my family that I’m close with would take quite a while of both my time and yours, seeing as you’d have a lot more to read. On this page, I intend to write predominantly about my immediate family and some of my best memories with them.</p>
      <p>One thing that my family does best is <em>food</em>. Food is at the forefront of any and all family gatherings. If my mother is having guests over, one of the first things we ask ourselves is “What should we make?”. Mom also helped in showing me how to cook basic meals so I could help out occasionally while she worked long nights at her office. I’m extremely grateful to my mother for raising me this way. If I hadn’t learned simple home cooking from her, I’d either be hunched over this laptop I'm writing on trying to follow a recipe or just cooking cup noodles every night.</p>
      <p>My father also played an integral part in my growth as a man. Not in just the typical “dad” ways like teaching me how to throw a baseball or showing me how to use a razor. My father introduced me to technology, and how it can be used to help people. My dad is an audio engineer at heart, but he has always been fascinated with the latest and greatest tech. I still remember the first time dad had helped me on a computer. I had made some sort of drawing in MS Paint to surprise him, but I couldn’t figure out how to make it his background. I was maybe four or five years old at the time, so I’m sure he had to muster up all the patience in his body to deal with me wanting to change his wallpaper. Without my father’s love for technology, I probably would not be enrolled in this course right now. Thanks, dad.</p>
      <p>My little brother, Gabriel, was probably the biggest change to my life. I was just about to turn ten years old when he was born. It was a Friday night. We’d typically be renting a movie and having pizza. My wonderful parents got me some GameBoy Advance Video cartridges that were packed with Pokemon episodes to make the time pass by a little quicker. I guess you could say I got my Friday-night movie after all! Hah. Shortly after Gabriel was born, I thought I’d go through the pains of being a neglected first child. That wasn’t the case. Growing up with my little brother ended up being the most enjoyable ten years of my life. </p>
