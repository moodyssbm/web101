      <h2>Trips</h2>
      <p>I love traveling. That should be apparent since I’m making a whole page about it. I could’ve just as easily worked this into my <a href=“hobbies.html”>Hobbies</a> page, but traveling has had the biggest impact on me personally. I’ve done plenty of traveling, and my parents made it a big part of their lives as well. When I was as young as two years old, my parents took me on a road trip from Florida to Maine. My father also took me on a road trip nearly every year for my birthday.</p>

      <p>Below, you can click on any of the three images to read about the most influential trips I’ve taken in my lifetime. I’ve made some of my best memories on these trips, and I hope you enjoy reading about them.</p>
