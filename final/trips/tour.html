      <h2>The Bad Guys, Good Friends Tour 2013</h2>
      <p>On Christmas day, 2013, I quit my job at SeaWorld, packed my bags, and headed for Winter Park to meet up with members of the band <em>Fear the Concept</em>. They had just booked a two-week tour across the east coast. I had known the members for some time, so they chose me to come along to shoot a live music video. We all piled into their van, Hank the Tank. Our first stop was Ohio, but they weren’t playing until the 27th.</p>

      <p>Over the course of the next two weeks, we met so many people and visited so many interesting places at our stops. Some of my favorites were an old catholic church turned insane asylum in Kent, OH, downtown Louisville, KY, and a small underground venue in Birmingham, AL. Getting to travel from Tampa to Cincinnati was truly an experience.</p>

      <p>One of my favorite moments was the New Year’s party in Daytona Beach. We didn’t have a show booked that night, so we went to a party. I had a ton of fun getting to relax with everyone that was on the tour. I won’t go into much detail, but I did not wake up in Daytona Beach once everything was said and done. It was a pretty wild night.</p>

      <p>If you’d like, you can view the final video below. I put a lot of work into making sure I captured a little of every stop.</p>
