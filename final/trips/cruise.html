      <h2>Mediterranean Cruise</h2>
      <p>A tradition in my family is that my grandparents on my mother’s side take a pair of grandchildren on a trip outside the US once they’re roughly thirteen years old. My cousin Sam and I went on a Mediterranean cruise in 2008. Most of our stops were made in Italy, but we also had a chance to visit the islands of Sicily and Malta as well as the country of of Croatia.</p>

      <p>Our trip started in Rome where we had to make our way to the coast. Once we arrived, we spent roughly a week making stops all around Italy, Malta, and Croatia. The cruise was fantastic. Most of the facilities operated all day and night. Sam and I would occasionally step out to enjoy goat cheese pizza or go for a dip in the pool.</p>

      <p>Italy was the main attraction here. We visited most of the key locations like the Colosseum, Vatican City, Spanish Steps, and many other places. While we did a lot of traveling around the country via the cruise ship, we did have a three night stay in Rome where we got to explore a lot of the city on foot.</p>

      <p>The journey to Malta just lasted a single day. I remember getting to eat at a local pizza place and being astounded that the Pepsi there tasted different from here in the US. My grandfather is notorious for doing as much as possible when given a limited amount of time. This showed when we visited a famous chapel in the area, only to find out that my grandmother wasn’t waiting outside for us. We worried at first, but quickly found out that she had taken a cab since it was getting close to the time we needed to return to the ship.</p>

      <p>We made our way to Croatia as the last stop on the ship. For the day, we explored the city of Dubrovnik. It was gorgeous. There were no roads for cars in the city, so everyone had to make it around on foot. We visited the standard local museums and shops. The locals were very kind and welcoming to the tourists that would frequently visit. </p>
