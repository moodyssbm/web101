      <h2>Tegucigalpa, Honduras</h2>
      <p>Honduras was definitely an interesting trip. I went for similar reasons to the tour, but I was documenting the trip more than shooting any specific type of video. I went with my Great Aunt and long-time client of my father, Cissy Padgett. She had written a children’s book about David & Goliath, and she had just had it translated into Spanish so she could distribute it to the children on the outskirts of the city who didn’t have access to the shops or churches that had these kinds of books.</p>

      <p>We spent most of our time in the capital city—Tegucigalpa—with a friend of Cissy’s, Becky Hoshaw. The most interesting thing about the urban area of the city was that there was no gradient in the population density. It was all tightly packed buildings and homes until you reached the city limit. Any farther, and you’d reach small towns filled with farms and huts for homes. </p>

      <p>While we were busy most days, we had a few days off. These were nice because we got to explore the city, do some shopping, and get some shots of the various locations around town. I didn’t struggle at all to become acclimated in the environment, and these days off surely helped with that. The city was so…<em>American</em>. I don’t really have any other words for it. The streets, malls, and Walmart were all very similar. They had mostly the same foods and stores you’d find around any city in the US.</p>

      <p>Like I stated previously, I did not go to shoot any particular type of video. However, you can check out Cissy’s website <a href=“http://musicalmission.org”>here</a>.</p>
