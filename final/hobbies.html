      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>If the icon in the navigation menu didn’t make it clear, my hobbies mainly revolve around computers. I have a history of working with my father on video projects, I’ve been playing video games for as long as I can remember, and I’m just starting to get into programming and computer development.</p>

      <p>Video games played (no pun intended) an important part in my childhood. As I grew up, my friends and I would play the latest and greatest games on the GameBoy Color, GameBoy Advance, and Nintendo DS because we could connect with each other on the go. If we weren’t on our handhelds, we were witnessing the advent of online gaming with services like Nintendo’s WFC, Xbox Live, and browser-based MMOs like RuneScape. Still to this day, gaming helps me form new friendships, have fun when I need to relax, and show me a world and its story like no other art form could.</p>

      <p>Film and video have been a passion of mine since my uncle Phil gave me my first SLR camera. As I honed my skills as a cinematographer and editor, I proposed to my father that we should start not just an audio company like he’d hoped for, but a company that could provide audio/visual services in a number of different facets. Soon enough, we had Moody Media Consultants up and running. My favorite thing about a video project is when you’re nearing the end of production and you can see all of your work start to come to fruition. It’s extremely satisfying.</p>

      <p>Programming is still somewhat new to me. I still don’t know entirely what I want to do, but I never want to stop practicing. When work is slow, I often find myself either trying to learn a new language or practicing one I already know. It’s interesting to me the most because I view programming as the ultimate art form. Depending on the end goal of your software, you could incorporate visual art, writing music, and much more. I’d argue that seeing a software project to completion is even more satisfying than tying up a video.</p>
