      <p>My name is Ethan Moody. At the time of submission for this final exam, I am 22 years old. I live in a small town called Sebring in south central Florida. I live on my own in an apartment right along the biggest lake in town. I love it here, but I am excited to move to Tennessee in 2017.</p>
      <p>I have a background in video and motion graphics, as my father and I share joint ownership of our company, Moody Media Consultants. I used to major in film until I began to take D.I.Y. courses in basic programming languages like Python and Ruby. Because I had immensely enjoyed myself learning how to write simple programs, I have transitioned majors. I hope to become a software engineer by the time I finish my bachelor’s degree. From there, I hope to at least complete my master’s degree.</p>
      <p>On this site, you’ll find information about my family, various hobbies, and favorite thing to do: travel! I’ve made some of the information interactive so that you can experience more on each page. You can also email me at <a href="mailto:ethan@immoody.com">ethan@immoody.com</a> if you experience any issues with this site. Thank you for stopping by!</p>
