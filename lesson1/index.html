		<h1>Learning Module 1 Assignment</h1>

		<!--VV Questions and answers VV-->

		<h2>What is your name?</h2>
		<p>Ethan Moody</p>

		<h2>What do you hope to learn in this course?</h2>
		<p>I hope to learn some new tricks to help me with web development.</p>

		<h2>What is the most important thing you learned in Chapter 1?</h2>
		<p>I got a little insight into how servers worked. They always seemed so ambiguous to me. Although brief, I'm glad I was able to read the section about them in the book.</p>

		<h2>Are you a Macintosh or PC user?</h2>
		<p>I will be primarily using my Macbook for portability's sake, but I may occasionally use my Windows/Linux desktop while at home.</p>

		<h2>What text editor are you using?</h2>
		<p>I will be using <a href="http://atom.io/">Atom</a>. It is the latest text editor from GitHub and is built on their <a href="http://electron.atom.io/">Electron</a> technology. Electron uses HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to make cross-platform desktop apps out of web apps. That trivial fact and its myriad of features make it <em>very</em> appropriate for a Web Design class.<br />(BONUS: Microsoft took up Electron to make <a href="http://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a>. This marks the year that Visual Studio has gone cross-platform.)</p>
